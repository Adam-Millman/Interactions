# **VR Interaction Research Proposal**  
**Name(s):** Adam Millman  
**Interaction Chosen:** Inventory Menu Design  

## 1. What interaction am I exploring?  
I am exploring how **inventory management systems** can be implemented in VR using three distinct methods: a **Button-Activated Floating Inventory**, a **Gesture-Based Menu**, and a **Body Socket (Holster) Menu**. Inventory interactions are crucial in VR for organizing tools, items, or resources, and I want to understand how different implementations impact usability, immersion, and accessibility. My goal is to determine which system provides the most effective and enjoyable experience for users based on various scenarios.

## 2. What 3 different ways will I implement it?

### 1. **Button-Activated Floating Inventory**  
- **Description:**  
  This inventory system activates with a button press (e.g., on the controller) and manifests as a 3D menu that follows the user’s hand. Users can interact with items by pointing and selecting, keeping the inventory within easy reach.

- **Rationale:**  
  This method combines the benefits of accessibility and efficiency, allowing users to focus on the virtual environment while having immediate access to their inventory. It minimizes physical movement, making it suitable for various VR experiences, especially in fast-paced scenarios.

- **Use Case Example:**  
  Effective in **action and adventure VR games** where quick access to tools and items is crucial (e.g., VR shooters or exploration games), as well as for **social VR environments** where users might need to manage items on the fly.

### 2. **Gesture-Based Inventory Menu**  
- **Description:**  
  A menu will appear in front of the player when they perform a predefined gesture (e.g., swiping down with their hand). Items are selected through additional gestures like pointing or pinching.

- **Rationale:**  
  Gesture-based interactions enhance **immersion** and free users from reliance on controllers. However, they require precise gesture recognition and may lead to fatigue if used frequently.

- **Use Case Example:**  
  Ideal for **hand-tracking focused VR experiences** such as fitness or creative tools, where fluid interaction is key (e.g., Quest 3 hand-tracking games).

### 3. **Body Socket (Holster) Inventory**  
- **Description:**  
  Items are stored in “holsters” located around the player’s body (e.g., at the waist or shoulder). Users reach toward these specific locations to retrieve or store items directly from their virtual body.

- **Rationale:**  
  This system maintains high immersion by allowing users to naturally grab items, minimizing on-screen clutter. However, it may pose challenges for users with limited mobility or those new to VR interactions requiring precise physical positioning.

- **Use Case Example:**  
  Effective in **action and adventure VR games** where quick access to tools and items is crucial (e.g., VR shooters or exploration games).

## 3. Conclusion  
This project will explore the differences between three inventory interaction methods to determine how they influence user experience. During testing, I will evaluate factors such as ease of use, speed, immersion, and accessibility. The findings will help inform how inventory systems should be designed for different types of VR applications, with a particular emphasis on the advantages of a button-activated floating inventory.
