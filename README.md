# **VR Interaction Research Proposal**  
**Name(s):** Adam Millman  
**Interaction Chosen:** Inventory Menu Design  

## 1. What interaction am I exploring?  
I am exploring how **inventory management systems** can be implemented in VR using three distinct methods: a **2D Menu**, **Gesture-based Menu**, and **Backpack Menu**. Inventory interactions are crucial in VR for organizing tools, items, or resources, and I want to understand how different implementations impact usability, immersion, and accessibility. My goal is to determine which system provides the most effective and enjoyable experience for users based on various scenarios.

## 2. What 3 different ways will I implement it?

### 1. **World-Fixed 2D Panel Inventory**  
- **Description:**  
  A 2D inventory panel will float in the virtual environment. Users will have to walk or teleport up to it and interact with the items through a laser pointer or by physically touching the panel.

- **Rationale:**  
  This system mimics real-world interfaces like cabinets or vending machines, providing an organized and familiar way to manage many items. However, requiring users to physically move toward the menu may reduce efficiency in time-sensitive situations.

- **Use Case Example:**  
  Suitable for **building games or simulations** where users need to manage many tools or materials in an orderly way (e.g., VR Minecraft mods).

### 2. **Gesture-Based Inventory Menu**  
- **Description:**  
  A menu will appear in front of the player when they perform a predefined gesture (e.g., swiping down with their hand). Items are selected through additional gestures like pointing or pinching.

- **Rationale:**  
  Gesture-based interactions enhance **immersion** and free users from reliance on controllers. However, they require precise gesture recognition and may lead to fatigue if used frequently.

- **Use Case Example:**  
  Ideal for **hand-tracking focused VR experiences** such as fitness or creative tools, where fluid interaction is key (e.g., Quest 3 hand-tracking games).

### 3. **Backpack Inventory**  
- **Description:**  
  Users can reach behind their back to access a virtual backpack. The backpack opens with a pull gesture, allowing them to grab items physically or scroll through contents with hand movements.

- **Rationale:**  
  This system provides a highly immersive experience and reduces on-screen clutter. However, it can be **challenging for users with limited mobility** or in cases where precise object tracking is necessary.

- **Use Case Example:**  
  Great for **immersive adventure or survival games** where item management should feel realistic (e.g., The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners).

## 3. Conclusion  
This project will explore the differences between three inventory interaction methods to determine how they influence user experience. During testing, I will evaluate factors such as ease of use, speed, immersion, and accessibility. The findings will help inform how inventory systems should be designed for different types of VR applications.
